# Senior_Thesis
For now, this repository will hold the contents of the Senior Thesis that I created while attending the University of North Texas. The thesis components focus around a rare earth-doped fiber optic laser and its surrounding components. It's a review of a previous experiment with a theoretical solution to be tested experimentally by me in the coming months.
